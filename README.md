# HelperTools

Started this, really back in 2013. Matured this over time, from Windows application to a WPF app and enhanced it, modified it, trimmed it to feature a generic Helper app. Another sidekick project on WPF, Windows store app.

## KEY FEATURES
* Delimitted editor - converts ANY delimited texts to DESIRED delimited text(s), array(s)
* Run My Query - a Quick run of any safe SQL query ( works with Sql server, MySql, Db2, Oracle) - one of those tools came in handy when i didnt have a proper visual tool to run Db2 queries. Later expanded the same to run against MySql and Oracle (this is still in trial mode :-) ) 
* Run As - elevated permissions, impersonated access for running any executable.
